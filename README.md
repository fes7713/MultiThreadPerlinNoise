# Abstract

# Requirement
- JDK 17
- IntelliJ 2021.3.1

# External Libraries
- vecmath 15.2 (https://jar-download.com/artifacts/javax.vecmath/vecmath/1.5.2/source-code)

# Launch
In order to start application, you need to have Java 17 installed on your computer. Compilation of Java source is needed to run this project. Since this program is created with IntelliJ, IDE from Jetbrain, it may be easier to run in the same environment.
1. Download project file from this repository
2. Import the project to the IntelliJ IDE
3. Go to Project Structure and link JDK 17 and vecmath to the project.
4. Run the project by hitting the Build button in the IED.

# What is Perlin map.Noise

Perlin map.Noise is a type of gradient noise that is often used to generate procedural terrain. My program uses perlin noise to generate terrain height map and it is a one of the core functions of this application.
<br>
First image shows a example of the 1D perlin noise. X axis represents the position of map where sample is taken from and y axis shows the height generated by the perlin noise for that coordinate of the map. As you can see perlin noise is able to generate the smooth height map along the change of the map coordinate and the property of the continuous generation of the smooth height map data is a key of the application.
<br>
Second image is the example of the 2D perlin noise with height map data for each pixel of the image with input of the x and y axis variables.

# Key Programming Solutions
Due to the heavy calculation take place in generating height map using perlin noise function, run time of the program was my first problem to be solve to have the smooth application exprience.
## Solutions

- Chunking
I divided map into smaller chunks to have the better program response and the program update each chunk indivisually and shows it once the calculation is done for that chunk.
- Multisthreading
Running each chunk in different threads and utilizing the machine performance was very good idea to solve the performance issue.

# Color Change Form

After the successful generation of the monochrome height map image, coloring the map was my next goal to have the clean map image. Colors used in the map is provided by gradient color panel.
## Key program ideas for the coloring of the map.
- 2D Color interpolation
- Live change of the color data on the map.
The color panel takes several color key points to generate complete color map. Colors between key points are linearly interpolated.

# Variable Change Form

# Fall Off Map

Edge of the map will be dropped like the above image and the region outside of the boundary is shown in darker color. 
## Fall Off Map editor

The application allows user to edit the width and height of the map region as well as the shape of the fall map. Users can interact with fall off map editor to edit inside variables for fall of mapp generator and find the best settings for the map.
